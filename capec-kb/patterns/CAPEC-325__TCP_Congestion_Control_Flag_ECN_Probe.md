# CAPEC-325: TCP Congestion Control Flag (ECN) Probe

**Abstraction:** Detailed  
**Status:** Stable  
**Likelihood of Attack:** Medium  
**Typical Severity:** Low  
**Reference:** https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/325.html  

## Description
This OS fingerprinting probe checks to see if the remote host supports explicit congestion notification (ECN) messaging. ECN messaging was designed to allow routers to notify a remote host when signal congestion problems are occurring. Explicit Congestion Notification messaging is defined by RFC 3168. Different operating systems and versions may or may not implement ECN notifications, or may respond uniquely to particular ECN flag types.
