# CAPEC-305: TCP ACK Scan

**Abstraction:** Detailed  
**Status:** Stable  
**Typical Severity:** Low  
**Reference:** https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/305.html  

## Description
An adversary uses TCP ACK segments to gather information about firewall or ACL configuration. The purpose of this type of scan is to discover information about filter configurations rather than port state. This type of scanning is rarely useful alone, but when combined with SYN scanning, gives a more complete picture of the type of firewall rules that are present.

## Related Attack Patterns
- ChildOf: CAPEC-300

## Prerequisites
- The adversary requires logical access to the target network. ACK scanning requires the use of raw sockets, and thus cannot be performed from some Windows systems (Windows XP SP 2, for example). On Unix and Linux, raw socket manipulations require root privileges.

## Resources Required
- This attack can be achieved via the use of a network mapper or scanner, or via raw socket programming in a scripting language. Packet injection tools are also useful for this purpose. Depending upon the method used it may be necessary to sniff the network in order to see the response.

## Consequences
- Scope: Confidentiality; Impact: Other
- Scope: Confidentiality, Access Control, Authorization; Impact: Bypass Protection Mechanism, Hide Activities

## Related Weaknesses (CWE)
- CWE-200
