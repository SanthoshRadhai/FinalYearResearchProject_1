# CAPEC-652: Use of Known Kerberos Credentials

**Abstraction:** Standard  
**Status:** Draft  
**Likelihood of Attack:** Medium  
**Typical Severity:** High  
**Reference:** https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/652.html  

## Description
An adversary obtains (i.e. steals or purchases) legitimate Kerberos credentials (e.g. Kerberos service account userID/password or Kerberos Tickets) with the goal of achieving authenticated access to additional systems, applications, or services within the domain.

## Related Attack Patterns
- ChildOf: CAPEC-560
- CanPrecede: CAPEC-151

## Prerequisites
- The system/application leverages Kerberos authentication.
- The system/application uses one factor password-based authentication, SSO, and/or cloud-based authentication for Kerberos service accounts.
- The system/application does not have a sound password policy that is being enforced for Kerberos service accounts.
- The system/application does not implement an effective password throttling mechanism for authenticating to Kerberos service accounts.
- The targeted network allows for network sniffing attacks to succeed.

## Skills Required
- [Low] Once an adversary obtains a known Kerberos credential, leveraging it is trivial.

## Resources Required
- A valid Kerberos ticket or a known Kerberos service account credential.

## Consequences
- Scope: Confidentiality, Access Control, Authentication; Impact: Gain Privileges
- Scope: Confidentiality, Authorization; Impact: Read Data
- Scope: Integrity; Impact: Modify Data

## Mitigations
- Create a strong password policy and ensure that your system enforces this policy for Kerberos service accounts.
- Ensure Kerberos service accounts are not reusing username/password combinations for multiple systems, applications, or services.
- Do not reuse Kerberos service account credentials across systems.
- Deny remote use of Kerberos service account credentials to log into domain systems.
- Do not allow Kerberos service accounts to be a local administrator on more than one system.
- Enable at least AES Kerberos encryption for tickets.
- Monitor system and domain logs for abnormal credential access.
