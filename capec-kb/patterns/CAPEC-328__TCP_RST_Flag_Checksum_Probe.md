# CAPEC-328: TCP 'RST' Flag Checksum Probe

**Abstraction:** Detailed  
**Status:** Stable  
**Likelihood of Attack:** Medium  
**Typical Severity:** Low  
**Reference:** https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/328.html  

## Description
This OS fingerprinting probe performs a checksum on any ASCII data contained within the data portion or a RST packet. Some operating systems will report a human-readable text message in the payload of a 'RST' (reset) packet when specific types of connection errors occur. RFC 1122 allows text payloads within reset packets but not all operating systems or routers implement this functionality.
