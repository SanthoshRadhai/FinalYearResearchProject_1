# CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes

**Abstraction:** Base  
**Status:** Incomplete  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/915.html  

## Description
The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies multiple attributes, properties, or fields that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control which attributes can be modified.

## Extended Description
If the object contains attributes that were only intended for internal use, then their unexpected modification could lead to a vulnerability. This weakness is sometimes known by the language-specific mechanisms that make it possible, such as mass assignment, autobinding, or object injection.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-913
- PeerOf: CWE-502

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Integrity; Impact: Modify Application Data — An attacker could modify sensitive data or program variables.
- Scope: Integrity; Impact: Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands
- Scope: Other, Integrity; Impact: Varies by Context, Alter Execution Logic

## Potential Mitigations
- [Implementation] If available, use features of the language or framework that allow specification of allowlists of attributes or fields that are allowed to be modified. If possible, prefer allowlists over denylists. For applications written with Ruby on Rails, use the attr_accessible (allowlist) or attr_protected (denylist) macros in each class that may be used in mass assignment.
- [Architecture and Design, Implementation] If available, use the signing/sealing features of the programming language to assure that deserialized data has not been tainted. For example, a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) could be used to ensure that data has not been modified.
- [Implementation] For any externally-influenced input, check the input against an allowlist of internal object attributes or fields that are allowed to be modified.
- [Implementation, Architecture and Design] Refactor the code so that object attributes or fields do not need to be dynamically identified, and only expose getter/setter functionality for the intended attributes.

## Detection Methods
- [Automated Static Analysis] Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

## Demonstrative Examples (summary)
