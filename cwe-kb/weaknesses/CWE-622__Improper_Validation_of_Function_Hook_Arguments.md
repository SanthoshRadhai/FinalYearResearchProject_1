**Abstraction:** Variant  
**Status:** Draft  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/622.html  

## Description
The product adds hooks to user-accessible API functions, but it does not properly validate the arguments. This could lead to resultant vulnerabilities.

## Extended Description
Such hooks can be used in defensive software that runs with privileges, such as anti-virus or firewall, which hooks kernel calls. When the arguments are not validated, they could be used to bypass the protection scheme or attack the product itself.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-20

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Integrity; Impact: Unexpected State

## Potential Mitigations
- [Architecture and Design] Ensure that all arguments are verified, as defined by the API you are protecting.
- [Architecture and Design] Drop privileges before invoking such functions, if possible.
