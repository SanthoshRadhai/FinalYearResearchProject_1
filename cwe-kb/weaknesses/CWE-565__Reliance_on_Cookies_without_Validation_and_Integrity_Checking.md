# CWE-565: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking

**Abstraction:** Base  
**Status:** Incomplete  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/565.html  

## Description
The product relies on the existence or values of cookies when performing security-critical operations, but it does not properly ensure that the setting is valid for the associated user.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-642
- ChildOf: CWE-669
- ChildOf: CWE-602

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability; Impact: Modify Application Data, Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands — Attackers can easily modify cookies, within the browser or by implementing the client-side code outside of the browser. Reliance on cookies without detailed validation and integrity checking can allow attackers to bypass authentication, conduct injection attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting, or otherwise modify inputs in unexpected ways.
- Scope: Access Control; Impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity — It is dangerous to use cookies to set a user's privileges. The cookie can be manipulated to escalate an attacker's privileges to an administrative level.

## Potential Mitigations
- [Architecture and Design] Avoid using cookie data for a security-related decision.
- [Implementation] Perform thorough input validation (i.e.: server side validation) on the cookie data if you're going to use it for a security related decision.
- [Architecture and Design] Add integrity checks to detect tampering.
- [Architecture and Design] Protect critical cookies from replay attacks, since cross-site scripting or other attacks may allow attackers to steal a strongly-encrypted cookie that also passes integrity checks. This mitigation applies to cookies that should only be valid during a single transaction or session. By enforcing timeouts, you may limit the scope of an attack. As part of your integrity check, use an unpredictable, server-side value that is not exposed to the client.

## Detection Methods
- [Automated Static Analysis] Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

## Demonstrative Examples (summary)
- The following code excerpt reads a value from a browser cookie to determine the role of the user.
