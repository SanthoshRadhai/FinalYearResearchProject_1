# CWE-298: Improper Validation of Certificate Expiration

**Abstraction:** Variant  
**Status:** Draft  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/298.html  

## Description
A certificate expiration is not validated or is incorrectly validated.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-295
- ChildOf: CWE-672

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Integrity, Other; Impact: Other — The data read from the system vouched for by the expired certificate may be flawed due to malicious spoofing.
- Scope: Authentication, Other; Impact: Other — Trust may be assigned to certificates that have been abandoned due to age.

## Potential Mitigations
- [Architecture and Design] Check for expired certificates and provide the user with adequate information about the nature of the problem and how to proceed.
- [Implementation] If certificate pinning is being used, ensure that all relevant properties of the certificate are fully validated before the certificate is pinned, including the expiration.

## Demonstrative Examples (summary)
- The following OpenSSL code ensures that there is a certificate and allows the use of expired certificates.
