# CWE-67: Improper Handling of Windows Device Names

**Abstraction:** Variant  
**Status:** Incomplete  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/67.html  

## Description
The product constructs pathnames from user input, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a pathname containing a Windows device name such as AUX or CON. This typically leads to denial of service or an information exposure when the application attempts to process the pathname as a regular file.

## Extended Description
Not properly handling virtual filenames (e.g. AUX, CON, PRN, COM1, LPT1) can result in different types of vulnerabilities. In some cases an attacker can request a device via injection of a virtual filename in a URL, which may cause an error that leads to a denial of service or an error page that reveals sensitive information. A product that allows device names to bypass filtering runs the risk of an attacker injecting malicious code in a file with the name of a device.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-66

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Availability, Confidentiality, Other; Impact: DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart, Read Application Data, Other

## Potential Mitigations
- [Implementation] Be familiar with the device names in the operating system where your system is deployed. Check input for these device names.
