# CWE-1060: Excessive Number of Inefficient Server-Side Data Accesses

**Abstraction:** Base  
**Status:** Incomplete  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1060.html  

## Description
The product performs too many data queries without using efficient data processing functionality such as stored procedures.

## Extended Description
While the interpretation of "too many data queries" may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default maximum of 5 data queries for an inefficient function/procedure.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-1120

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Other; Impact: Reduce Performance — This issue can make the product perform more slowly due to computational expense. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability.
