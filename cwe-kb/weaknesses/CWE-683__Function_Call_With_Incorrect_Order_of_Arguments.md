# CWE-683: Function Call With Incorrect Order of Arguments

**Abstraction:** Variant  
**Status:** Draft  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/683.html  

## Description
The product calls a function, procedure, or routine, but the caller specifies the arguments in an incorrect order, leading to resultant weaknesses.

## Extended Description
While this weakness might be caught by the compiler in some languages, it can occur more frequently in cases in which the called function accepts variable numbers or types of arguments, such as format strings in C. It also can occur in languages or environments that do not enforce strong typing.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-628

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Other; Impact: Quality Degradation

## Potential Mitigations
- [Implementation] Use the function, procedure, or routine as specified.

## Detection Methods
- [Automated Analysis] Because this function call often produces incorrect behavior, it will usually be detected during testing or normal operation of the product.
- [Automated Analysis] Exercising all possible control paths will typically expose this weakness, except in rare cases when the incorrect function call accidentally produces the correct results, or if the provided argument type is very similar to the expected argument type.

## Demonstrative Examples (summary)
- The following PHP method authenticates a user given a username/password combination but is called with the parameters in reverse order.
