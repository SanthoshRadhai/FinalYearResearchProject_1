# CWE-412: Unrestricted Externally Accessible Lock

**Abstraction:** Base  
**Status:** Incomplete  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/412.html  

## Description
The product properly checks for the existence of a lock, but the lock can be externally controlled or influenced by an actor that is outside of the intended sphere of control.

## Extended Description
This prevents the product from acting on associated resources or performing other behaviors that are controlled by the presence of the lock. Relevant locks might include an exclusive lock or mutex, or modifying a shared resource that is treated as a lock. If the lock can be held for an indefinite period of time, then the denial of service could be permanent.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-667
- CanAlsoBe: CWE-410

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Availability; Impact: DoS: Resource Consumption (Other) — When an attacker can control a lock, the program may wait indefinitely until the attacker releases the lock, causing a denial of service to other users of the program. This is especially problematic if there is a blocking operation on the lock.

## Potential Mitigations
- [Architecture and Design, Implementation] Use any access control that is offered by the functionality that is offering the lock.
- [Architecture and Design, Implementation] Use unpredictable names or identifiers for the locks. This might not always be possible or feasible.
- [Architecture and Design] Consider modifying your code to use non-blocking synchronization methods.

## Detection Methods
- [White Box] Automated code analysis techniques might not be able to reliably detect this weakness, since the application's behavior and general security model dictate which resource locks are critical. Interpretation of the weakness might require knowledge of the environment, e.g. if the existence of a file is used as a lock, but the file is created in a world-writable directory.

## Demonstrative Examples (summary)
- This code tries to obtain a lock for a file, then writes to it.
