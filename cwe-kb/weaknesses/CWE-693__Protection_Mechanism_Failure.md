# CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure

**Abstraction:** Pillar  
**Status:** Draft  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html  

## Description
The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product.

## Extended Description
This weakness covers three distinct situations. A "missing" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An "insufficient" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an "ignored" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Access Control; Impact: Bypass Protection Mechanism
