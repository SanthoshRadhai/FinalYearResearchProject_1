# CWE-511: Logic/Time Bomb

**Abstraction:** Base  
**Status:** Incomplete  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/511.html  

## Description
The product contains code that is designed to disrupt the legitimate operation of the product (or its environment) when a certain time passes, or when a certain logical condition is met.

## Extended Description
When the time bomb or logic bomb is detonated, it may perform a denial of service such as crashing the system, deleting critical data, or degrading system response time. This bomb might be placed within either a replicating or non-replicating Trojan horse.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-506

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Other, Integrity; Impact: Varies by Context, Alter Execution Logic

## Potential Mitigations
- [Installation] Always verify the integrity of the product that is being installed.

## Detection Methods
- [Automated Static Analysis] Conduct a code coverage analysis using live testing, then closely inspect any code that is not covered.

## Demonstrative Examples (summary)
- Typical examples of triggers include system date or time mechanisms, random number generators, and counters that wait for an opportunity to launch their payload. When triggered, a time-bomb may deny service by crashing the system, deleting files, or degrading system response-time.
