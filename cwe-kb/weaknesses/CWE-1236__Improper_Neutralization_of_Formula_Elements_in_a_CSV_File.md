# CWE-1236: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File

**Abstraction:** Base  
**Status:** Incomplete  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1236.html  

## Description
The product saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by a spreadsheet product.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-74
- ChildOf: CWE-74

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Confidentiality; Impact: Read Application Data, Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands — Attackers can populate data fields which, when saved to a CSV file, may attempt information exfiltration or other malicious activity when automatically executed by the spreadsheet software. Note that current versions of Excel warn users of untrusted content.

## Potential Mitigations
- [Implementation] When generating CSV output, ensure that formula-sensitive metacharacters are effectively escaped or removed from all data before storage in the resultant CSV. Risky characters include '=' (equal), '+' (plus), '-' (minus), and '@' (at).
- [Implementation] If a field starts with a formula character, prepend it with a ' (single apostrophe), which prevents Excel from executing the formula.
- [Architecture and Design] Certain implementations of spreadsheet software might disallow formulas from executing if the file is untrusted, or if the file is not authored by the current user.

## Detection Methods
- [Automated Static Analysis] Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

## Demonstrative Examples (summary)
- Hyperlinks or other commands can be executed when a cell begins with the formula identifier, '='
