# CWE-8: J2EE Misconfiguration: Entity Bean Declared Remote

**Abstraction:** Variant  
**Status:** Incomplete  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/8.html  

## Description
When an application exposes a remote interface for an entity bean, it might also expose methods that get or set the bean's data. These methods could be leveraged to read sensitive information, or to change data in ways that violate the application's expectations, potentially leading to other vulnerabilities.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-668

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Confidentiality, Integrity; Impact: Read Application Data, Modify Application Data

## Potential Mitigations
- [Implementation] Declare Java beans "local" when possible. When a bean must be remotely accessible, make sure that sensitive information is not exposed, and ensure that the application logic performs appropriate validation of any data that might be modified by an attacker.

## Demonstrative Examples (summary)
- The following example demonstrates the weakness.
