# CWE-506: Embedded Malicious Code

**Abstraction:** Class  
**Status:** Incomplete  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/506.html  

## Description
The product contains code that appears to be malicious in nature.

## Extended Description
Malicious flaws have acquired colorful names, including Trojan horse, trapdoor, timebomb, and logic-bomb. A developer might insert malicious code with the intent to subvert the security of a product or its host system at some time in the future. It generally refers to a program that performs a useful service but exploits rights of the program's user in a way the user does not intend.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-912

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability; Impact: Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands

## Potential Mitigations
- [Implementation, Operation] Remove the malicious code and start an effort to ensure that no more malicious code exists. This may require a detailed review of all code, as it is possible to hide a serious attack in only one or two lines of code. These lines may be located almost anywhere in an application and may have been intentionally obfuscated by the attacker.

## Detection Methods
- [Manual Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode] According to SOAR [REF-1479], the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Binary / Bytecode disassembler - then use manual analysis for vulnerabilities & anomalies Generated Code Inspection
- [Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation] According to SOAR [REF-1479], the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Automated Monitored Execution
- [Manual Static Analysis - Source Code] According to SOAR [REF-1479], the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Manual Source Code Review (not inspections)
- [Automated Static Analysis] According to SOAR [REF-1479], the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Origin Analysis

## Demonstrative Examples (summary)
- In the example below, a malicous developer has injected code to send credit card numbers to the developer's own email address.
