# CWE-57: Path Equivalence: 'fakedir/../realdir/filename'

**Abstraction:** Variant  
**Status:** Incomplete  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/57.html  

## Description
The product contains protection mechanisms to restrict access to 'realdir/filename', but it constructs pathnames using external input in the form of 'fakedir/../realdir/filename' that are not handled by those mechanisms. This allows attackers to perform unauthorized actions against the targeted file.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-41

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Confidentiality, Integrity; Impact: Read Files or Directories, Modify Files or Directories

## Potential Mitigations
- [Implementation] Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.
