# CWE-1428: Reliance on HTTP instead of HTTPS

**Abstraction:** Base  
**Status:** Incomplete  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1428.html  

## Description
The product provides or relies on use of HTTP communications when HTTPS is available.

## Extended Description
Because HTTP communications are not encrypted, HTTP is subject to various attacks against confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. However, unlike many other protocols, HTTPS is widely available as a more secure alternative, because it uses encryption.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-319

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Confidentiality, Integrity; Impact: Read Application Data, Modify Application Data — HTTP can be subjected to attacks against confidentiality (by reading cleartext packets); integrity (by modifying sessions); and authenticity (by compromising servers and/or clients using cache poisoning, phishing, or other attacks that enable attackers to spoof a legitimate entity in the communication channel).

## Potential Mitigations
- [Architecture and Design] Explicitly require HTTPS or another mechanism that ensures that communication is encrypted [REF-1464].
- [Implementation] Avoid using "mixed content," i.e., serving a web page over HTTPS in which the page includes elements that use "http:" URLs [REF-1466] [REF-1467]. This is often done for images or other resources that do not seem to have privacy or security implications.
- [Implementation, Operation] Perform "HTTPS forcing," that is, redirecting HTTP requests to HTTPS.
- [Operation] If the product supports multiple protocols, ensure that encrypted protocols (such as HTTPS) are required, and remove any unencrypted protocols (such as HTTP).
