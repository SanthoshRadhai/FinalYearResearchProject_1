# CWE-342: Predictable Exact Value from Previous Values

**Abstraction:** Base  
**Status:** Draft  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/342.html  

## Description
An exact value or random number can be precisely predicted by observing previous values.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-340

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Other; Impact: Varies by Context

## Potential Mitigations
- Increase the entropy used to seed a PRNG.
- [Architecture and Design, Requirements] Use products or modules that conform to FIPS 140-2 [REF-267] to avoid obvious entropy problems. Consult FIPS 140-2 Annex C ("Approved Random Number Generators").
- [Implementation] Use a PRNG that periodically re-seeds itself using input from high-quality sources, such as hardware devices with high entropy. However, do not re-seed too frequently, or else the entropy source might block.
