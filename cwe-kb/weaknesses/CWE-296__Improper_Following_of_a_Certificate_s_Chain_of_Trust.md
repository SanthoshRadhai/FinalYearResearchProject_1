# CWE-296: Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust

**Abstraction:** Base  
**Status:** Draft  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/296.html  

## Description
The product does not follow, or incorrectly follows, the chain of trust for a certificate back to a trusted root certificate.

## Extended Description
There are several ways in which the chain of trust might be broken, including but not limited to: Any certificate in the chain is self-signed, unless it is the root. Not every intermediate certificate is checked, starting from the original certificate all the way up to the root certificate. An intermediate, CA-signed certificate does not have the expected Basic Constraints or other important extensions. The root certificate has been compromised or authorized to the wrong party.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-295
- ChildOf: CWE-573

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Non-Repudiation; Impact: Hide Activities — Exploitation of this flaw can lead to the trust of data that may have originated with a spoofed source.
- Scope: Integrity, Confidentiality, Availability, Access Control; Impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity, Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands — Data, requests, or actions taken by the attacking entity can be carried out as a spoofed benign entity.

## Potential Mitigations
- [Architecture and Design] Ensure that proper certificate checking is included in the system design.
- [Implementation] Understand, and properly implement all checks necessary to ensure the integrity of certificate trust integrity.
- [Implementation] If certificate pinning is being used, ensure that all relevant properties of the certificate are fully validated before the certificate is pinned, including the full chain of trust.

## Detection Methods
- [Automated Static Analysis] Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

## Demonstrative Examples (summary)
- This code checks the certificate of a connected peer.
