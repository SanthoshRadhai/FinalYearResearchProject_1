# CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity

**Abstraction:** Base  
**Status:** Draft  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html  

## Description
The product uses a regular expression with a worst-case computational complexity that is inefficient and possibly exponential.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-407
- ChildOf: CWE-407

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Availability; Impact: DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU) — Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike.

## Potential Mitigations
- [Architecture and Design] Use regular expressions that do not support backtracking, e.g. by removing nested quantifiers.
- [System Configuration] Set backtracking limits in the configuration of the regular expression implementation, such as PHP's pcre.backtrack_limit. Also consider limits on execution time for the process.
- [Implementation] Do not use regular expressions with untrusted input. If regular expressions must be used, avoid using backtracking in the expression.
- [Implementation] Limit the length of the input that the regular expression will process.

## Detection Methods
- [Automated Static Analysis] Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

## Demonstrative Examples (summary)
- This example attempts to check if an input string is a "sentence" [REF-1164].
- This example attempts to check if an input string is a "sentence" and is modified for Perl [REF-1164].
