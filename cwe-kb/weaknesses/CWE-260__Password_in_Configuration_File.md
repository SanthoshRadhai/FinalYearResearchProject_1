# CWE-260: Password in Configuration File

**Abstraction:** Base  
**Status:** Incomplete  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/260.html  

## Description
The product stores a password in a configuration file that might be accessible to actors who do not know the password.

## Extended Description
This can result in compromise of the system for which the password is used. An attacker could gain access to this file and learn the stored password or worse yet, change the password to one of their choosing.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-522

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Access Control; Impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity

## Potential Mitigations
- [Architecture and Design] Avoid storing passwords in easily accessible locations.
- [Architecture and Design] Consider storing cryptographic hashes of passwords as an alternative to storing in plaintext.

## Detection Methods
- [Automated Static Analysis] Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

## Demonstrative Examples (summary)
- Below is a snippet from a Java properties file.
- The following examples show a portion of properties and configuration files for Java and ASP.NET applications. The files include username and password information but they are stored in cleartext.
