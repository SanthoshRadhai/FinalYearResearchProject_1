# CWE-64: Windows Shortcut Following (.LNK)

**Abstraction:** Variant  
**Status:** Incomplete  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/64.html  

## Description
The product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently handle when the file is a Windows shortcut (.LNK) whose target is outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-59

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Confidentiality, Integrity; Impact: Read Files or Directories, Modify Files or Directories — The shortcut (file with the .lnk extension) can permit an attacker to read/write a file that they originally did not have permissions to access.

## Potential Mitigations
- [Architecture and Design] Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning access rights to entities in a software system. Denying access to a file can prevent an attacker from replacing that file with a link to a sensitive file. Ensure good compartmentalization in the system to provide protected areas that can be trusted.
