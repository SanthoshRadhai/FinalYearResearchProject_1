# CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation

**Abstraction:** Pillar  
**Status:** Draft  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/682.html  

## Description
The product performs a calculation that generates incorrect or unintended results that are later used in security-critical decisions or resource management.

## Extended Description
When product performs a security-critical calculation incorrectly, it might lead to incorrect resource allocations, incorrect privilege assignments, or failed comparisons among other things. Many of the direct results of an incorrect calculation can lead to even larger problems such as failed protection mechanisms or even arbitrary code execution.

## Related Weaknesses
- CanPrecede: CWE-170

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Availability; Impact: DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart — If the incorrect calculation causes the program to move into an unexpected state, it may lead to a crash or impairment of service.
- Scope: Integrity, Confidentiality, Availability; Impact: DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart, DoS: Resource Consumption (Other), Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands — If the incorrect calculation is used in the context of resource allocation, it could lead to an out-of-bounds operation (CWE-119) leading to a crash or even arbitrary code execution. Alternatively, it may result in an integer overflow (CWE-190) and / or a resource consumption problem (CWE-400).
- Scope: Access Control; Impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity — In the context of privilege or permissions assignment, an incorrect calculation can provide an attacker with access to sensitive resources.
- Scope: Access Control; Impact: Bypass Protection Mechanism — If the incorrect calculation leads to an insufficient comparison (CWE-697), it may compromise a protection mechanism such as a validation routine and allow an attacker to bypass the security-critical code.

## Potential Mitigations
- [Implementation] Understand your programming language's underlying representation and how it interacts with numeric calculation. Pay close attention to byte size discrepancies, precision, signed/unsigned distinctions, truncation, conversion and casting between types, "not-a-number" calculations, and how your language handles numbers that are too large or too small for its underlying representation.
- [Implementation] Perform input validation on any numeric input by ensuring that it is within the expected range. Enforce that the input meets both the minimum and maximum requirements for the expected range.
- [Implementation] Use the appropriate type for the desired action. For example, in C/C++, only use unsigned types for values that could never be negative, such as height, width, or other numbers related to quantity.
- [Architecture and Design] Use languages, libraries, or frameworks that make it easier to handle numbers without unexpected consequences. Examples include safe integer handling packages such as SafeInt (C++) or IntegerLib (C or C++).
- [Architecture and Design] Use languages, libraries, or frameworks that make it easier to handle numbers without unexpected consequences. Examples include safe integer handling packages such as SafeInt (C++) or IntegerLib (C or C++).
- [Implementation] Examine compiler warnings closely and eliminate problems with potential security implications, such as signed / unsigned mismatch in memory operations, or use of uninitialized variables. Even if the weakness is rarely exploitable, a single failure may lead to the compromise of the entire system.

## Detection Methods
- [Manual Analysis] This weakness can be detected using tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session. Specifically, manual static analysis is useful for evaluating the correctness of allocation calculations. This can be useful for detecting overflow conditions (CWE-190) or similar weaknesses that might have serious security impacts on the program.
- [Automated Static Analysis] Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)
- [Fuzzing] Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a powerful technique for generating large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or algorithmically - and dynamically invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing effectively produces repeatable test cases that clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.

## Demonstrative Examples (summary)
- The following image processing code allocates a table for images.
- This code attempts to calculate a football team's average number of yards gained per touchdown.
- This example attempts to calculate the position of the second byte of a pointer.
