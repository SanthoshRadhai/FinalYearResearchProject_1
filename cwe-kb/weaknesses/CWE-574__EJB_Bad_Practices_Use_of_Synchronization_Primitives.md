# CWE-574: EJB Bad Practices: Use of Synchronization Primitives

**Abstraction:** Variant  
**Status:** Draft  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/574.html  

## Description
The product violates the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) specification by using thread synchronization primitives.

## Extended Description
The Enterprise JavaBeans specification requires that every bean provider follow a set of programming guidelines designed to ensure that the bean will be portable and behave consistently in any EJB container. In this case, the product violates the following EJB guideline: "An enterprise bean must not use thread synchronization primitives to synchronize execution of multiple instances." The specification justifies this requirement in the following way: "This rule is required to ensure consistent runtime semantics because while some EJB containers may use a single JVM to execute all enterprise bean's instances, others may distribute the instances across multiple JVMs."

- ChildOf: CWE-695
- ChildOf: CWE-821

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Other; Impact: Quality Degradation

## Potential Mitigations
- [Implementation] Do not use Synchronization Primitives when writing EJBs.

## Demonstrative Examples (summary)
- In the following Java example a Customer Entity EJB provides access to customer information in a database for a business application.
