# CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow

**Abstraction:** Variant  
**Status:** Draft  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html  

## Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-788
- ChildOf: CWE-787

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Availability; Impact: Modify Memory, DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart, DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU), DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory) — Buffer overflows generally lead to crashes. Other attacks leading to lack of availability are possible, including putting the program into an infinite loop.
- Scope: Integrity, Confidentiality, Availability, Access Control; Impact: Modify Memory, Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands, Bypass Protection Mechanism — Buffer overflows often can be used to execute arbitrary code, which is usually outside the scope of a program's implicit security policy.
- Scope: Integrity, Confidentiality, Availability, Access Control, Other; Impact: Modify Memory, Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands, Bypass Protection Mechanism, Other — When the consequence is arbitrary code execution, this can often be used to subvert any other security service.

## Potential Mitigations
- [Operation, Build and Compilation] Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail.
- [Architecture and Design] Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.
- [Implementation] Implement and perform bounds checking on input.
- [Implementation] Do not use dangerous functions such as gets. Use safer, equivalent functions which check for boundary errors.
- [Operation, Build and Compilation] Run or compile the software using features or extensions that randomly arrange the positions of a program's executable and libraries in memory. Because this makes the addresses unpredictable, it can prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to exploitable code. Examples include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) [REF-58] [REF-60] and Position-Independent Executables (PIE) [REF-64]. Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as "rebasing" (for Windows) and "prelinking" (for Linux) [REF-1332] using randomly generated addresses. ASLR for libraries cannot be used in conjunction with prelink since it would require relocating the libraries at run-time, defeating the whole purpose of prelinking. For more information on these techniques see D3-SAOR (Segment Address Offset Randomization) from D3FEND [REF-1335].

## Detection Methods
- [Fuzzing] Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a powerful technique for generating large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or algorithmically - and dynamically invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing effectively produces repeatable test cases that clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.
- [Automated Static Analysis] Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)
- [Automated Dynamic Analysis] Use tools that are integrated during compilation to insert runtime error-checking mechanisms related to memory safety errors, such as AddressSanitizer (ASan) for C/C++ [REF-1518].

## Demonstrative Examples (summary)
- While buffer overflow examples can be rather complex, it is possible to have very simple, yet still exploitable, stack-based buffer overflows:
- This example takes an IP address from a user, verifies that it is well formed and then looks up the hostname and copies it into a buffer.
