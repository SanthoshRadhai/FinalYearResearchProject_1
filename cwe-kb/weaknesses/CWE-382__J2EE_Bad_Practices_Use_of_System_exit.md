# CWE-382: J2EE Bad Practices: Use of System.exit()

**Abstraction:** Variant  
**Status:** Draft  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/382.html  

## Description
A J2EE application uses System.exit(), which also shuts down its container.

## Extended Description
It is never a good idea for a web application to attempt to shut down the application container. Access to a function that can shut down the application is an avenue for Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-705

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Availability; Impact: DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart

## Potential Mitigations
- [Architecture and Design] The shutdown function should be a privileged function available only to a properly authorized administrative user
- [Implementation] Web applications should not call methods that cause the virtual machine to exit, such as System.exit()
- [Implementation] Web applications should also not throw any Throwables to the application server as this may adversely affect the container.
- [Implementation] Non-web applications may have a main() method that contains a System.exit(), but generally should not call System.exit() from other locations in the code

## Detection Methods
- [Automated Static Analysis] Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

## Demonstrative Examples (summary)
- Included in the doPost() method defined below is a call to System.exit() in the event of a specific exception.
