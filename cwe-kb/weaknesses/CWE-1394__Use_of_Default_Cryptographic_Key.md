# CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key

**Abstraction:** Base  
**Status:** Incomplete  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1394.html  

## Description
The product uses a default cryptographic key for potentially critical functionality.

## Extended Description
It is common practice for products to be designed to use default keys. The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults, it is easier for attackers to bypass authentication quickly across multiple organizations.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-1392

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Authentication; Impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity

## Potential Mitigations
- [Requirements] Prohibit use of default, hard-coded, or other values that do not vary for each installation of the product - especially for separate organizations.
- [Architecture and Design] Force the administrator to change the credential upon installation.
- [Installation, Operation] The product administrator could change the defaults upon installation or during operation.
