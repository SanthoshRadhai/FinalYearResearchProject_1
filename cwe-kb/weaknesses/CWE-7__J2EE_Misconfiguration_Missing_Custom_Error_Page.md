# CWE-7: J2EE Misconfiguration: Missing Custom Error Page

**Abstraction:** Variant  
**Status:** Incomplete  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/7.html  

## Description
The default error page of a web application should not display sensitive information about the product.

## Extended Description
A Web application must define a default error page for 4xx errors (e.g. 404), 5xx (e.g. 500) errors and catch java.lang.Throwable exceptions to prevent attackers from mining information from the application container's built-in error response. When an attacker explores a web site looking for vulnerabilities, the amount of information that the site provides is crucial to the eventual success or failure of any attempted attacks.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-756

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Confidentiality; Impact: Read Application Data — A stack trace might show the attacker a malformed SQL query string, the type of database being used, and the version of the application container. This information enables the attacker to target known vulnerabilities in these components.

## Potential Mitigations
- [Implementation] Handle exceptions appropriately in source code.
- [Implementation, System Configuration] Always define appropriate error pages. The application configuration should specify a default error page in order to guarantee that the application will never leak error messages to an attacker. Handling standard HTTP error codes is useful and user-friendly in addition to being a good security practice, and a good configuration will also define a last-chance error handler that catches any exception that could possibly be thrown by the application.
- [Implementation] Do not attempt to process an error or attempt to mask it.
- [Implementation] Verify return values are correct and do not supply sensitive information about the system.

## Demonstrative Examples (summary)
- In the snippet below, an unchecked runtime exception thrown from within the try block may cause the container to display its default error page (which may contain a full stack trace, among other things).
