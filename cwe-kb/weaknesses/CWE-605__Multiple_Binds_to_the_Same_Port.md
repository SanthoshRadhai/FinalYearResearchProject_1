# CWE-605: Multiple Binds to the Same Port

**Abstraction:** Variant  
**Status:** Draft  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/605.html  

## Description
When multiple sockets are allowed to bind to the same port, other services on that port may be stolen or spoofed.

## Extended Description
On most systems, a combination of setting the SO_REUSEADDR socket option, and a call to bind() allows any process to bind to a port to which a previous process has bound with INADDR_ANY. This allows a user to bind to the specific address of a server bound to INADDR_ANY on an unprivileged port, and steal its UDP packets/TCP connection.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-675
- ChildOf: CWE-666

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Confidentiality, Integrity; Impact: Read Application Data — Packets from a variety of network services may be stolen or the services spoofed.

## Potential Mitigations
- [Policy] Restrict server socket address to known local addresses.

## Detection Methods
- [Automated Static Analysis] Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

## Demonstrative Examples (summary)
- This code binds a server socket to port 21, allowing the server to listen for traffic on that port.
