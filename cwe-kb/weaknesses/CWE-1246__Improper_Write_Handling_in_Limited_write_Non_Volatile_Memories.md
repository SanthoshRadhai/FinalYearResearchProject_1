# CWE-1246: Improper Write Handling in Limited-write Non-Volatile Memories

**Abstraction:** Base  
**Status:** Incomplete  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1246.html  

## Description
The product does not implement or incorrectly implements wear leveling operations in limited-write non-volatile memories.

## Extended Description
Non-volatile memories such as NAND Flash, EEPROM, etc. have individually erasable segments, each of which can be put through a limited number of program/erase or write cycles. For example, the device can only endure a limited number of writes, after which the device becomes unreliable. In order to wear out the cells in a uniform manner, non-volatile memory and storage products based on the above-mentioned technologies implement a technique called wear leveling. Once a set threshold is reached, wear leveling maps writes of a logical block to a different physical block. This prevents a single physical block from prematurely failing due to a high concentration of writes.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-400

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Availability; Impact: DoS: Instability — If wear leveling is improperly implemented, attackers may be able to programmatically cause the storage to become unreliable within a much shorter time than would normally be expected.

## Potential Mitigations
- [Architecture and Design, Implementation, Testing] Include secure wear leveling algorithms and ensure they may not be bypassed.

## Demonstrative Examples (summary)
- An attacker can render a memory line unusable by repeatedly causing a write to the memory line.
