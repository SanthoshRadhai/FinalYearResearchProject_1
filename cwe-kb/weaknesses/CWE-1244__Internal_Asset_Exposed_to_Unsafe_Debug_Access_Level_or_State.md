# CWE-1244: Internal Asset Exposed to Unsafe Debug Access Level or State

**Abstraction:** Base  
**Status:** Stable  
**Reference:** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1244.html  

## Description
The product uses physical debug or test interfaces with support for multiple access levels, but it assigns the wrong debug access level to an internal asset, providing unintended access to the asset from untrusted debug agents.

## Extended Description
Debug authorization can have multiple levels of access, defined such that different system internal assets are accessible based on the current authorized debug level. Other than debugger authentication (e.g., using passwords or challenges), the authorization can also be based on the system state or boot stage. For example, full system debug access might only be allowed early in boot after a system reset to ensure that previous session data is not accessible to the authenticated debugger.

## Related Weaknesses
- ChildOf: CWE-863

## Common Consequences
- Scope: Confidentiality; Impact: Read Memory — If a protection mechanism does not ensure that internal assets have the correct debug access level during each boot stage or change in system state, an attacker could obtain sensitive information from the internal asset using a debugger.
- Scope: Integrity; Impact: Modify Memory
- Scope: Authorization, Access Control; Impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity, Bypass Protection Mechanism

## Potential Mitigations
- [Architecture and Design, Implementation] For security-sensitive assets accessible over debug/test interfaces, only allow trusted agents.
- [Architecture and Design] Apply blinding [REF-1219] or masking techniques in strategic areas.
- [Implementation] Add shielding or tamper-resistant protections to the device, which increases the difficulty and cost for accessing debug/test interfaces.

## Detection Methods
- [Manual Analysis] Check 2 devices for their passcode to authenticate access to JTAG/debugging ports. If the passcodes are missing or the same, update the design to fix and retest. Check communications over JTAG/debugging ports for encryption. If the communications are not encrypted, fix the design and retest.

## Demonstrative Examples (summary)
- The JTAG interface is used to perform debugging and provide CPU core access for developers. JTAG-access protection is implemented as part of the JTAG_SHIELD bit in the hw_digctl_ctrl register. This register has no default value at power up and is set only after the system boots from ROM and control is transferred to the user software.
- The example code below is taken from the CVA6 processor core of the HACK@DAC'21 buggy OpenPiton SoC. Debug access allows users to access internal hardware registers that are otherwise not exposed for user access or restricted access through access control protocols. Hence, requests to enter debug mode are checked and authorized only if the processor has sufficient privileges. In addition, debug accesses are also locked behind password checkers. Thus, the processor enters debug mode only when the privilege level requirement is met, and the correct debug password is provided.
